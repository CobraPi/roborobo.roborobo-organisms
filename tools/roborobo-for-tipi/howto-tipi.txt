= ROBOROBO KIT FOR TIPI =
=========================

## Quick intro ##

This file and directory should be useful for people working at LRI / Univ. Paris-Sud and 
wishing to run their roborobo code on the "tipi" cluster. More generaly, it may be useful
for anyone wishing to run roborobo on a linux machine with restricted rights, as it describes
how to compile and run roborobo with a local installation of the mandatory SDL library.

## Install ##

0 - uncompress sdl_files.tgz

1 - move sdl directory wherever you want

      e.g.: /users/dsa/bredeche

2 - move Makefile.tipi in your roborobo directory

3 - modify Makefile.tipi for matching with sdl directory location

      replace <FULL_PATH_TO_SDL_LIB_HERE>
        e.g. /users/dsa/bredeche/sdl/lib
      replace <FULL_PATH_TO_SDL_INCLUDE_HERE>
        e.g. /users/dsa/bredeche/sdl/include

4 - modify your ~/.bashrc (or equivalent) to add path to sdl lib directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

      e.g.: add "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH":<FULL_PATH>/sdl/lib"
	OR "setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH":<FULL_PATH>/sdl/lib"


## Usage ##

  make -f Makefile.tipi
  ./roborobo-tipi -l <myconfigfile>

if you want to launch an experiment and disconnect:
  1. set gBatchmode to true in the config file
  2. launch "nohup ./roborobo-tipi -l config/<myconfigfile> &"
